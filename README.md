# CSCI 4830 - HW4
## Name: Caleb Cordsen
Hi this is my repo for my code for Homework 4 of Mathematical & Computational Modeling of Infectious Diseases.
I worked in the Juypter Notebook (.ipynb) file but included a .py file version as well. Please note that the relevant .csv files (all_weeks.csv, HW4_Q3_data.csv, HW4_Q3_neg.csv, HW4_Q3_pos.csv) need to be in the local directory as the file you are running (whether that be the notebook or .py).
